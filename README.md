# Image-Compression-Using-Quad-Trees
Quadtrees for image compression works by recursively dividing the image into four subspaces with each holding the average RGB color. 



Steps to run the code


step 1:
  make

step 2:
./compress -c compression_level <input_image> <output_image> 

BY giving above to commands you will be able to run the code.

In this code you have to take only ppm imges of same dimension.

The input ppm image and output image size is same but when you convert the output ppm image to any format you will see the compression 

#Note:
For converting ppm to any format or any format to ppm on linux there is command.


command:convert Rupesh.ppm rupesh.png
